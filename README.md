*Course Feedback System was built as the course project in Applied Database Practicum (Oct-Nov, 2015), IIT Mandi.*  
The project enables students to give feedback for the courses they've registered (the registration data for each student is stored in a CSV file). The admin has the ability to modify/add/delete questions for a particular course, but only before recieving feedback from any student. The instructor can see the average response to a particular course along with the average response for a particular question. The student after giving feedback for a course can not alter their responses.  
  
The student data (imported from the CSV file) was managed in a MySQL database. The frontend was developed using HTML,CSS,PHP,JavaScript and AJAX. Refer to the documentation for the steps to deploying the portal.  
  
*NOTE* : For setting up LAMP, use *sudo apt-get install lamp-server^* (instead of the steps given in the documentation).
